# ImageFinder
Object Detection model that predicts the number inside the image.

This uses a pre-trained dataset I made in Roboflow. 

Object Detection model that predicts the number inside the image.

This app works without the need for ultralytics.
It is pulling the pre trained dataset and classes straight from Roboflow.

To make improvements to the code we need to test the max capacity for images in a folder and the time it is capable of returning images in.
