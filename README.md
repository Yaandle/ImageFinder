# ImageFinder
Object Detection model that predicts the number inside the image.

This uses a pre-trained dataset made in Roboflow with 100+ classes. 

Ultralytics YOLOV8.

App.py allows users to enter a 'folder path' and 'class number' sorts through an image directory and filters the images that contain the user-entered 'class_name' within the prediction to a downloaded zip folder.
