# ImageFinder
Object Detection model that predicts the number inside the image.

This uses a pre-trained dataset I made in Roboflow. 

Ultralytics YOLOV8.

The Test.py code sorts through an image directory and filters the images that contain the user-entered 'class_name' within the prediction to a downloaded zip folder.
